                        was project director of the SLV-III, the
                        first satellite launch vehicle that was

                    <p> Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                        Kalam planned the program that produced
                        a number of successful missiles, which
                        helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                            “Missile Man.”</strong>

                        was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                        ballistic missile, which incorporated
                        aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                        in 1989.

                        minister, and he later served as principal

                        the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                        solidified India as a nuclear power and
                        established Kalam as a national hero,
                        although the tests caused great concern
                        in the international community.

                    <p> In 1998 Kalam put
                        forward a countrywide plan called
                        Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                        as a road map for transforming India from
                        a less-developed to a developed society
                        in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                        other measures, increasing agricultural
                        productivity, emphasizing technology as
                        a vehicle for economic growth, and
                        widening access to health care and
